# skeldoc.sty

The **skeldoc** package lets you produce placeholder elements for documents
under development, similar to the skeleton screens used while loading contents
in many applications and websites. It also has a mechanism for attaching
explanatory endnotes to these placeholders, or to anything else in your
document. For an example of use, along with some explanations, see the file
[skeldoc.pdf](skeldoc.pdf), or [its source](skeldoc.tex).

The package is written by [Magnus Lie Hetland](mailto:mlh@ntnu.no) and is
released under the [MIT license](LICENSE).
